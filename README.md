# 🏦 Bank Loan Default Risk Analysis

This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns that help predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan. The analysis helps financial institutions minimize risk and make better lending decisions.

## 📊 Project Objective

To explore and analyze customer data to:

- Identify characteristics of defaulters vs. non-defaulters
- Understand key risk factors (e.g., income, job type, loan amount)
- Support decision-making for loan approvals

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
